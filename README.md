This is the README file for CTA200H Assignment 1, due Wednesday, May 6th by 5pm.

The goal of this assignment is to practice using the command line and git.

A Github account was made for Sarah Thiele using the email sthiele@shaw.ca

The remote git pository is contained within /home/sthiele/repos/CTA200.git

The local git repository is in /home/sthiele/Assign1/CTA200

I assumed the files were main.c as the main program, average.c as a functional code, and average.h as an include file.
